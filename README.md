#NUMBER GUESSING GAME
This is a simple console-based number guessing game built in Python. 
The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it. 
After each guess, the program gives a hint:
“Lower please” — if the guess is higher than the number
“Higher please” — if the guess is lower than the number
The game also tracks the number of attempts. If the player does not guess the number within 10 attempts, the game ends and the player loses.
